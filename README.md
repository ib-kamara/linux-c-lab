# Linux, Shell, and C Lab

## Overview
This repository contains my work for the Ubuntu Linux command line, shell scripting, and C programming lab.

## Structure
- command-line-easy/: Logs from command-line tasks (easy-log.txt, intermediate-log.txt, advanced-log.txt)
- shell-scripts/: Shell scripts for automation
- c-programs/: C programs with compilation

## Testing and Running
- **Command Line:** Used `ls`, `cd`, `chmod`, `find`, etc. in Codespaces. See log files.
- **Shell Scripts:** Ran scripts with input (easy-greet.sh, file-check.sh, file-count.sh).
- **C Programs:** Compiled with `gcc` and ran (hello.c, add.c, factorial.c, contacts.c).
- **Project:** `project.sh` compiles and runs contacts, creates a backup, and logs output.
